## 🔹 Part A: Theoretical Questions 

Practice the following questions and write code where required:

1. **Code Output + Explanation**  
   What will be the output of the given JavaScript code? Explain why.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af9b3458-628c-416e-841d-d2daa22ded4c)



2. **Type Conversion**  
   What will be the output of the code snippet? Explain the type conversions happening.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68f9f7f2-f76c-4b72-ab02-ce5860fd25b3)




3. **Data Conversion Tasks**  
   Convert the following in JavaScript:
   - String `"123"` to Number  
   - Number `456` to String  
   - String `"true"` to Boolean  
   - Array `[1, 2, 3]` to String

4. **Stack vs Heap Memory**  
   Explain the difference between **stack** and **heap** memory in JavaScript. Give examples of what is stored where.

5. **Memory Allocation Explanation**  
   Analyze the given code and explain what happens in memory (stack/heap).![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eb5cdc5-8265-4c83-a185-5ef4bc1dbea9)



6. **String Analysis Function**  
   Write a function that:
   - Takes a string as input  
   - Returns an object with:  
     → string length  
     → first and last character  
     → string in uppercase

7. **Math Object Usage**  
   Write code to:
   - Generate a random number between 10 and 50  
   - Round `4.7` to the nearest integer  
   - Find the maximum of `[3, 7, 2, 9, 1]`

8. **Student Array Functions**  
   Create an array of student objects with `name`, `age`, and `grade`.  
   Write functions to:
   - Add a new student  
   - Find student by name  
   - Get all students with `grade > 80`

9. **Destructuring**  
   Demonstrate array and object destructuring with examples.

10. **Function Types in JS**  
    Explain the difference between:

    When would you use each?


11. **Higher-Order Function**  
    Write a higher-order function that:
    - Takes an array and a callback function  
    - Returns a new array with the callback applied to each element

12. **Hoisting**  
    Explain hoisting with examples. What will be the output of the given code?![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/763396c6-7195-4610-a018-f0dac2ee6a79)



13. **The `this` Keyword**  
    Explain `this` in different contexts:
    - Global scope  
    - Object method  
    - Arrow function  
    - Regular function

## 🔹 Part B: Practical Coding Questions (10 Marks)

Solve the following using JavaScript. Include clean, commented code.

14. **IIFE & Private Counter**  
    Create an IIFE that:
    - Maintains a private counter variable (starts at 0)  
    - Returns an object with `increment()`, `decrement()`, and `getValue()` methods

15. **Date & Time Manipulation**  
    Write a function that:
    - Takes a birthdate (`YYYY-MM-DD`)  
    - Returns age in years, months, days  
    - Also returns the day of the week they were born

16. **Array Methods with Products**  
    Given an array of products:
    - Filter products under `$600`  
    - Calculate total price  
    - Group products by category

17. **Object Manipulation & JSON**  
    Write a function that:
    - Takes user data as a JSON string  
    - Parses it to an object  
    - Validates `name`, `email`, and `age`  
    - Returns success/error message with cleaned data

18. **Text Analyzer**  
    Create a function that:
    - Counts words, characters, sentences  
    - Finds the longest word  
    - Converts to title case  
    - Removes extra whitespace

19. **Callbacks & Higher-Order Functions**  
    Write a function `processArray` that:
    - Takes an array and multiple callbacks  
    - Applies each callback in order to the array  
    - Returns the final result
